# My VIM

This is my personal preference.
If you have an idea i'm all ears and maybe I can add them.

But a vim setup it is all personal ofcourse and hopefully you can get started this way.
Love to hear you're tought about my vim-setup.

## How to use my vim setup?

### Clone this repository:
For HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/dpater1986/myvim.git myvim
```
For SSH
```
git clone git@github.com:dpater1986/myvim.git myvim
```
For GitHub CLI
```
gh repo clone dpater1986/myvim myvim
```
1 Run this command:
```
cd myvim && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

Now you can update it by going in the directory and type:
```
cd myvim && git pull origin main && ./setup.sh && cd
```
